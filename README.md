## Install

### Packaged releases

Check out [the releases section](https://github.com/nmaggioni/gerph/releases) for ready-to-run binaries. [Here's the latest one!](https://github.com/nmaggioni/gerph/releases/latest)

### From source

Given that your `$PATH` already has `$GOPATH/bin` in it, get the package and install it:

```
$ go install github.com/nmaggioni/gerph
```

## Usage

### WebUI

Gerph has an easy to use Dashboard that covers all the basic operations, reachable at the root of the domain. You can move around using the arrow keys too.

### CLI

Gerph has some useful command line options, you can check them by using the help flag:

```
$ gerph -h
```
### API

Being based on [bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), Gerph has the concept of _buckets_: they are containers of key/value pairs.

**All endpoints answer in JSON format.** The following table summarizes the available routes and their parameters, expressed in the form of _`:parameter`_ :

| HTTP Method | Path | Explanation |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| OPTIONS | /api | Will show a list of all the endpoints grouped by method. |
| GET | /api | Will reply with a listing of all the buckets and their keys. |
| GET | /api/:bucket | Will show all the keys inside the specified bucket. |
| DELETE | /api/:bucket | Will delete the specified bucket and its keys. |
| GET | /api/:bucket/:key | Will reply with the content of the specified key of the specified bucket. |
| PUT or POST | /api/:bucket/:key | Will set the content of the specified key of the specified bucket to the given content. Content must be sent in `x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding (`Content-Type` header set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), and the value of the key must be set to the `value` field.|
| DELETE | /api/:bucket/:key | Will delete the specified key of the specified bucket. |

Each call can answer with one of these status codes:

+ `200` - OK
+ `204` - No Content
+ `400` - Bad Request
+ `500` - Internal Server Error

## Examples

To access the WebUI just point your browser to the root of the domain: `http://localhost:3000/`.

### cURL
Setting a key:

```bash
curl -X PUT -d 'value=myValue' "http://localhost:3000/api/myBucket/myKey"
```

Getting a key:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/myBucket/myKey"
```

Getting all keys of a bucket:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/myBucket"
```

Getting all keys of all buckets:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/"
```

## Known issues

+ **At the moment Gerph is only capable of storing strings as values.** If other types of data are in need of being stored, the effort of casting back and forth from strings to the actual data type falls on the developer.
